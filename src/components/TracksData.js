        TracksAbout: "Climate refers to the kind of weather that's typically expected in a region. This includes describing the range of conditions that are possible. Climate change is a long-term shift in the average weather conditions of a region, such as its typical temperature, rainfall, and windiness. Sustainability is concerned with protecting the planet, halting climate change and promoting social development, without endangering life on Earth or leaving anyone behind. This concept seeks to cover our present needs without compromising resources for future generations."
